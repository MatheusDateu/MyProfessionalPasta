      <h2>Introduction about IBM (Index Body Mass)</h2>
      <p>
        The body mass is a important atribute since humans are alive. Over time
        the body pattern has been setting and alternating at we have now.
        Sometimes the pattern was to be skinny other times be chubby. And more
        recentrly the standard was have a healed body. By the way what the
        science says about it? Well, there is something named Index Body Mass or
        just IBM. That's the point. According to IBM rules we can verify what's
        the status of the body just dividing a person's weight in kilograms by
        the square of height in meters. Then the weight is categorized as under,
        normal, over, obese or extremely obese. You can get your diagnosis in
        the next topic.
